= Releasing Kiali UI

Kiali is released using a Jenkins Pipeline. The main document covering
the release process can be found
link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali/blob/master/RELEASING.adoc[here].

== Versioning scheme

The versioning scheme that we are following is similar to
link:http://semver.org[semver], but not as strict, given both that we are not
1.0 yet and that we are the end product, in the sense that nothing should
depend on us to do anything. For now, and that might change in the future, our
API is private and we make no guarantees that compatibility is going to be
maintaned.

For our versioning scheme, the `major` part means a major release, and that's
decided in advance by the team. The `minor` means new features are included
with the release, and the `patch` version covers only bugfixes.

The UI and the core might be out of sync in `patch` versions, but they should
be in sync for `minor`. That means that, if the UI is 0.5.10, then any core
version on 0.5.X should work with it, but that are no guarantees that it will
work with core 0.4.X or core 0.6.X.

Of course, that's a soft limitation, and your mileage may vary. Sometimes it
might work just fine, we just don't give any guarantees that it will.

== Running the release process locally

If you don't have access to the Jenkins instance or the release process
through Jenkins doesn't suit your needs, you may want to run the release
process _locally_.

This guide covers releasing only kiali-ui.

=== Requirements

You must have write permissions to the kiali-ui public GitHub repository in
order to be able to push the tags. You will also need an NPM account that
is able to publish to the NPM @kiali organization.

You will need a working dev environment for kiali-ui (git, npm, yarn, etc).
You will also need the following tools available in your $PATH:

* https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq] - a JSON processor used to update the
  package.json file
* https://github.com/fsaintjacques/semver-tool[semver] shell utility - used
  to update version numbers
* make - to run the release process
* curl - because the release process places PRs using the GitHub API

If you want the release process to push a PR for you to prepare the code for
the next release, you will need a GitHub Token for your account.

It's assumed that you are running the release process in your fork of the
kiali-ui repository.

=== Making the release

. Login to NPM using the user with write access to the NPM @kiali organization:
** `npm login`
. Checkout the code that you want to release:
** `git checkout branch_to_release` (usually, you should release "master")
** Be advised that the release process will commit changes locally.
. The release process may need to create a PR to prepare the code for the next
  version. A GitHub token is required to create the PR:
** `export GH_TOKEN={your_github_token}`
** This is optional. If a token is not provided, a branch is created in your
   fork of the code, if needed. Then, you can place the PR manually.
. Run the release process:
** `make -f Makefile.jenkins release`

By default, it's assumed that you are doing a _minor_ release.
If want to do another type of release, you can run the release process specifying
the RELEASE_TYPE variable. Valid values are "major", "minor", "patch", "edge" and
"snapshot._X_". For example:

* `RELEASE_TYPE="snapshot.1" make -f Makefile.jenkins release`

*Note*: The process will adjust the version string as needed, according to
the type of release. Please, don't try to adjust the version string (i.e.
don't change the version in `package.json`).

*Note*: The release process has not been tested for `RELEASE_TYPE=major` yet.

=== Available options

* If you want to make a "dry-run" of the release:
** `NPM_DRY_RUN=y make -f Makefile.jenkins release`
* In _major_, _minor_ or _patch_ mode, the release process updates or creates
  a version branch in the kiali-ui repository (the branch name is like
  "vMAJOR.MINOR"). You can omit this:
** `OMIT_VERSION_BRANCH=y make -f Makefile.jenkins release`
* In _major_, _minor_ or _patch_ mode, the release
  process may create a branch in your fork of the repository with
  the required changes to prepare the code for the next release. The branch is
  created if it isn't possible to push to the kiali-ui repository. By default, the
  name of the branch is _prepare_next_version_. If you want to customize the
  name of the branch:
** `BUMP_BRANCH_ID={branch_name} make -f Makefile.jenkins release`
* If your NPM account don't have write privileges to the @kiali organization but
  you have a token with the required privileges, you can use that token:
** `NPM_TOKEN="{your_token}" make -f Makefile.jenkins release`
